  "description": "Maddog has been working on Project Caua for nine years, and talking about it for seven years, after Douglas Conrad of OpenS came on board.  People at FISL have listened to V1.0, V0.5 and V0.1 version plans, but none of them have proven themselves in field test.  Now Project Caua is at V0.0, and having passed a limited field test, we would like to expand the field test, allowing high school seniors and university students to make money part time during their university years at a pay scale better than flipping hamburgers and waiting tables, at the same time learning how to run their own business and be their own boss.  Come to this one hour talk and learn how Project Caua has changed, and decide if you wish to attend the two hour training workshop to be offered later at FISL.",
