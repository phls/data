  "description": "Containers on Linux are one of today's hottest topics. In this presentation I'd like to discuss what systemd has to offer in this area. We'll specifically discuss the systemd-nspawn, systemd-machined and systemd-importd components of systemd, and how they fit into the broader container ecosystem. We'll discuss how containers are now integral part of the OS, and how you can take benefit of this.",
