  "description": "Log data provides critical insights into software systems. However, in the age of ubiquitous computing, unifying logs from hundreds of data sources with different data formats presents a big challenge. Fluentd is an open source data collector that solves this problem by providing a unified logging layer with pluggable and reliable architecture. In this presentation, I will talk about different use cases including mobile backend systems for logging and automotive sensor data collection and discuss how we can collect data from these sources in a maintainable, scalable manner, focusing on cloud-based backend systems.",
