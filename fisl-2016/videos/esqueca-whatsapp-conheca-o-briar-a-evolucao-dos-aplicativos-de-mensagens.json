  "description": "Mobile messengers have largely replaced email and SMS for most people. Many\nprovide more security by default while being easier to use. However, most\nexisting messaging applications (even WhatsApp) are still not where we need\nthem to be. This presentation will show the short-comings of the existing\nmessengers and show how Briar improves the status quo.\n\nBriar is completely Free Software and works peer-to-peer. It is designed to\nresist surveillance and censorship by an adversary with capabilities matching\nthose of the NSA while still being easy to use.\n\nMore information is available at:\nhttps://briarproject.org/\nhttps://dymaxion.org/essays/briarvision.html",
