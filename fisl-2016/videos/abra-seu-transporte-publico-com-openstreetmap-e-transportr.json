  "description": "In this presentation, I will show how the Free Software community can help to\nimprove the traffic problems in our cities by making public transport more\naccessible.\n\nI will explain how I opened up the public transport data of the Sistema\nIntegrado de Mobilidade in Florian\u00f3polis, so it can be used by the Free\nSoftware application Transportr and many other tools.\n\nUsing data from OpenStreetMap, the local consortium and the Prefeitura, I was\nable to write reusable Free Software tools to generate data in GTFS, the de-\nfacto standard for public transport data.\n\nWith this, you can not only look up when the next bus comes, but also do\nrouting, so finding out how to get from A to B. Since the data is open and the\nsoftware free, the possibilities are endless.\n\nIf you want to open up the public transport of your city, don't miss the\nworkshop!",
